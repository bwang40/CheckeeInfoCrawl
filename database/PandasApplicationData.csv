A week later, when we tried to pick up the passport with visa stamp from the post office. we were told that my passport is not ready for pickup. until then, I suspect that I was under the additional administrative processing. I and my employer faxed a letter to the embassy. Later, I called the DOS. my case is still pending.

I checked with DoS by phone twice for status inquiry.
I asked my former advisor at US called chief of visa section, DoS.
I faxed US embassy once for expedited visa processing with no reply and faxed once again yesterday for status inquiry and then the visa got approved today.
I also faxed US embassy for expedited visa appointment and got approved.
In summary, email/phone inquiry does help to some extent, but not much, at least no hurt.

yykang,J1,New,ShangHai,molecular biology,Clear,2010-05-19,2010-07-02,44,"ne 17, call to DOS, it is unfortunately that my visa is still pending
June 21, email DOS, here is the response. 
A check of the records at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, China indicates that J-1 exchange visitor visa application is currently undergoing administrative processing in order to verify his qualifications. 
Administrative processing usually lasts about 60 days, but can take longer in some instances.  We realize that any period of wait can be frustrating, and we are sensitive to the fact that the purpose of the nonimmigrant visa program is to facilitate legitimate travel to the U.S.  Nonetheless, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, like all U.S. Embassies and Consulates, must adjudicate visas in accordance with the provisions of the law, and, in some cases, this will involve extensive administrative processing. 

submit the questionaire on July 1

check EMS and find that Visa has been sented July 2

take visa by myself, Issued on July 2

bless all!!

I called DOS on July 7, July 14 and July 21, the result was always pending.
But I got the call in letter by EMS from Guangzhou consulate on July 26, the call in letter date is July 19, it looks like Guangzhou consulate has delayed this by one week. Then I returned to Guangzhou consulate on July 27 to send passports and was informed to go back consulate again on July 29. 
On July 29 I went back to consulate and got the red slip for immigrant visa approval, then I went to counter for EMS delivery.
On July 31 I got my immigrant visa and IV packets. It is shown on visa that clearance was received on July 16. I took only 22 days. And DOS information is always not updated.

My last visa application took 16 days to do the security check.(9.18 interview, 10.4 clear, 10.9 issuance, 10.11 received)

The coming visit is to continue the project I have not finished and the cooperation with the lab I visited. My J1 category is short-term this time. 

VO is a white man who is likely from Europe. First of all, He proceeded my case and I gave him my resume, research plan, my US supervisor's resume. 

VO: Are you a ph.d student? 
Me: No, I graduated a few months ago and am working in the same institute as a postdoctoral researcher. 
Vo: what does RPC stand for? (RPC is a acronym in my research plan) 
Me; Resistive Plate Chamber, and this is a scheme of RPC(I pointed a figure in my publicated paper) 

Then, he asked my wife's application documents(At that time I realized my application is not rejected at least).He asked my wife whether she can speak English. 

My wife(in Chinese): I can speak English a little bit,but I prefer the interview in Chinese. 

VO:ڹô 
My wife ǵġ ˹֤ 

We showed our pictures, letters and marriage certifate to him. 

Finally, he returned our DS2019 and gave a green slip to my wife for mail service. 

VO: your passport will be returned to CASdue to my passport which is for public affairsin 3 weeks, and your wife's passport will be mailed to her by China post. 

Me: Is it approved? 
VO: Yes, but it will take 3 weeks.(This means check, that's why I have not received my visa yet) 
Me: Thanks a lot, have a wonderful day! 

VO gave back my DS2019,my wife's DS2019 and invitation letter, and kept our passports, my resume, my US supervisor's resume and my research plan. 

I guess this check is due to my undergraduate major(nuclear project and nuclear technology)

I hope I am lucky like last time!!

1.I submitted a questionnaire in http://national-academies.org/visas in 2nd July, there has been no response yet.

Also shot an email to FMJVisas@state.gov and they replied at 6:30am on Sep 14th saying my visa application was still pending and normally it took 60 days...(OMG...) I was really frustrated this morning, but then the visa approved email came right after the previous email....

Interview Date: Sept 27th. 2010
On Thursday 30th, I got a call from the embassy, stating the visa stamping was delayed due to administrative processing. Initially, they said it was going to take 3 weeks.

Update:
Got the call from the embassy on Jan 3, send the passport Jan 4th, got them back on Jan 11th.

Additional Comment:
My wife had the interview on Dec 14th (H4 visa type). On that interview the consular officer told her that they were going to send a reminder to the US Department of State. Apparently that reminder expedited the process, or probably they were just waiting for both of us to renew the visa"

Got US visa many times before without any problem

Update: After I got my VISA, I saw that my checking was cleared on 10/15. But the damn Ireland Embassy spent another 3 more weeks to issue my VISA. I got my passport and VISA on 11/10/2010.

Another observation is that DOS information is not accurate at all. I usually made three phone calls on one day to verify the information, and most of the time I got different answers from different representatives. One (black female) was very rude, and she always answered "" to="""" try="""" up="""" usually="""" very="""" was="""" waste="""" white="""" with="""" young=""""> 90% chance that another representative will answer my phone), until I reach a nice people.

My experience is, don't waste your time with those rude/impolite ppl at all! Make a few more calls and you will know them - I can recognize their voices after a few days.

As I applied in a third country, I wrote down all my experiences, hoping this can help you.
Good luck to all of you!

这次碰到了6号的严肃大哥。他之前拒了n个B类签证。我碰到他，就觉得不妙。我自认英文口语还是很好的。他问了很多问题，还和同事讨论了，问了我的 research statement and CV.还问了怎么转学生签证了。做什么研究的。他同事说没问题，我那时很高兴，心想应该没问题。没想到，他说Everything looks all right.

He thought they should check what I have done. I told him I need to go back in three weeks and already booked the flight. He said it is a routine, and everyone has the same problem. He asked for my resume, I-20, study plan, financial support, and advisor's website. He said it is good to have all the documents to facilitate the process. He also said they made improvements on their process. It should be quick. He said it typically takes three weeks and the fastest ones need two weeks.

我和我lp一起申请的J1J2，我老婆的J2签证的check 1月3号就结束了，
我自己的比她晚了快4周，郁闷死了，总算最后是clear了。

在pending期间，我几乎每周都给大使馆发信催问，
我在clear的2周前填写了International Visitors Office的visa questionaire，不确定是否真有用，反正try了，建议以后的checkee都去填一下。

我觉得自己在申请签证有一个失误的地方就是简历给的太详细了，当时没想太多，给了自己找工作的3页的简历，内容很丰富，估计是送到FBI去审核了，我老婆给了1页的简历，3周多就过了，建议大家以后不需要给太详细的简历，当然不能隐瞒重要的背景，可以考虑给一个1页的简历，如果大使馆那边要求补材料再加，应该可以有效地减少check的时间。

最后祝福所有的checkee都好运！坚持就是胜利！"

耐心等了一个月，心态很平和，1月初开学了，签证还没下来，开始急，找老板和学校都往华盛顿写了Support letter，华盛顿那个超过21天就可以填写的调查问卷也填了但是没什么效果，作罢，权衡之下决定办理休学一个Quarter。
期间往北京大使馆打通过2次电话，但是他们什么都不帮忙查，没有任何作用。然后基本每个星期给华盛顿打一次电话，查询结果都是Pending，问其他具体的细节，已经进行到什么阶段，被告知无可奉告。结论：给华盛顿打电话的作用只能是尽早知道Clear的消息而已。

One big lesson is that I didn't prepare enough application material at interview. Three weeks after the interview, I was requested to submit a letter from my institution stating that my research is not involved with any technology export.

He then collected my and my advisor's CVs and transcript. Finally, I was clearly told that my application has been approved. I20 was returned. 
However, I have not received my issued passport yet. 
There was two point which is probably useful for future people. Firstly, I have not been told my application would be subject to administrative processing during the interview session but actually underwent this process. Secondly, my first VISA appplication was also subject to this process, which is two years ago. This suggests the popularly accepted notion that people who have been checked in previous application history will not be checked again, is not true. 
update: Clear email received on Sep 23.

I encourage everybody suffering from administrative processing write down their process so that the future people including yourself, might benefit from it.

Received a text from post office that my passport was sending out yesterday, without any email from the embassy. Finally received my passport with VISA today. It appears that the VISA was issued on 27 JUN.

I provided a simple and general answer of my research topic by avoiding sensitive words. He was content with it and said 'it's interesting'. 

However, when he saw the information that I would go to department of electrical and computer engineering, he seemed to be a little bit surprised, and confirmed it with me. It was from this point that he decided to check me, I think. After two more simple questions such as 'when will you start your program', he asked me to go back to seats and wait, till the other VO call me and ask me some more questions. 

After a while, the other VO just asked for my CV, contract, information of future boss, research plan, AND itinerary (nobody mentioned it before, and I didn't prepare it. So the VO asked me to email her the itinerary afterwards). She said I should wait about two weeks, and they will call me to come back, with my passport and DS2019. I received a yellow paper with words that my application was not approved because of lacking necessary documents (flight itinerary). 

I emailed the itinerary two hours later, and received an auto-reply saying that my application is going through an administrative processing...

This processing cannot be waived, and the final decision on visa issuance can only take place after this processing is completed.  At this time, consular officers are advising applicants that this processing may average around 3-4 weeks (upon receiving all required documents); however, processing times may vary from individual to individual.

My interview was at 09:00 am. Reached a little early (8:00 am). Waited at Starbucks at the corner of the street. Went to stand in the queue around 8:35am. 
For those going to Toronto-Canada, there are 3 stages.
After you clear the security. 
1) One lady checked my passport, and took my I-797 and put it in an envelope. She gave me a token number and asked e to go wait in line to be finger-printed.
2) Got finger printed. Here they took the envelope containing my passport and I-797.
3) VO called me (token number XX) to the interview.
VO: So your petitioner is XXXX
ME: YES.
VO: You came here from the US?
ME: YES.
VO: Are you currently working in the US?
ME: YES.
VO was typing something on her computer, and she suddenly looked confused. I thought something was wrong.
VO: Have you ever been on Bench?
ME: NO.
VO: May I see your paystubs ?
ME: Sure. (Gave her all my paystubs - from the beginning of when I started work)
VO just had a look at the latest 10 paystubs.
VO: So have you been looking at XXX since you were in US?
ME: No. I have been there since XXX
VO: What were you doing before that?
ME: (explained my itinerary since the time I was in US)
VO kept typing something into her system, and I started getting a little anxious. Hoped everything was well.

A VO (a white man who was arguing with a old man for about 15mins, seems he got rejected). After glanced at my passport, he asked me as follows:

1. What are you doing in Canada? (Student, but not mention in which university)
2. Did you work in China? (yep)
3. How long? (I said half a year, actually it's just a couple of months for eaning allowance. He was working on the computer at the same time.)
3. What did you do there? (Never thought he would ask such a question, I said Material Engineer. He was still working on the computer, I then supplemented I also worked as a telecommunication engineer. WTF! I should not have answered like that! In fact I was an intern out there!)
4. Do you bring your CV? (I did not catch this and asked for pardon me, then I realized he was asking for my resume! No one told me I should bring it, because my classmates who are majoring in Chemical Engineering of Master degree, just like me, were not asked for this.)
 
He was working on the computer, asked his colleague to make a copy of my passport. Then took a blue paper (221G as you know), then asked me to email my resume to the email addr (ottawaadmproc@state.gov).

I realized it should have gone out and printed a copy of my resume and then bring it back, maybe it could minimize the waiting time!

He did not open any other documents, which was wasting my money for issuing the transcript and statement of studies)

I came back home and revised my resume, I found out that I only mentioned only the Telecommunication Engineer in my DS-160. So I modified my resume, underlining that my second 2-month job was an internship.

I knew they would check me, as they did before, so I gave them everything but my advisor's resume.
Consulate called me on May 8:
Asked for my advisor's resume. I faxed it to them on the same day.
First updated on June 5, still AP:
I called the DOS the same day, they told me that the clearance was received, but not print yet.
Second updated on June 6:
Issued.

It turns out all my materials are in Shanghai Consulate the whole time. It is my understanding that for a 'short' 4-week check, the consulate updates the information, then inform the DOS. So no point to call the DOS if everything remains the same. By the way, DOS has a new number since the last year: 202-485-7600. Good luck to everyone!"

Under the AP since 05/30/14.

07/01/14 I made a phone call to the DoS. But it did not help at all.
The visa specialist on the phone said my case was not the investigation (check) on my research but some other necessary processing. She also said the processing time for my case should not be more than 6 weeks.

I was crazy on 07/30 because I planed to go back before end of July but nothing updated by that time. I lost 10K US dollar due to my late coming back. Then I wrote down a very strong email to ask the fucking embassy. After few minutes, they reply me just wait and be patient. Shit!!!

VO required more information about my advisor's research background which I couldn't provide in the interview, so I had to submitted all the materials he asked to CITIC Bank ASAP after my interview.

After almost four weeks waiting (w/o any update on CEAC website), I emailed them via their offcial website (general inquiry) on July 22:
http://shanghai.usembassy-china.org.cn/visas/contact-us.html  

Their first response: Sorry, your application is still undergoing AP. We are hopeful that this will be completely in the near future.

I asked them if there was anything I can do to shorten this process because I don't wanna miss my July 30 flight, otherwise I am gonna have a lot of troubles to deal with.

Then they replied: Your application's AP is ongoing. What is the last day you can arrive at school?

I told them definitely before August, I really cannot miss my flight. I asked them if it is possible to get me visa issued before the end of this week cuz after they issue my visa, I still need to wait another couple of days to get my passport back.

Then they replied: We have added your July 31 report date to your case file, and inquired into the status of your case's processing. 

I am not sure whether sending VO emails would help here, but at least, no harm.

Hopefully the details of my case would be helpful to you guys.

So the officer told me to come at earlier morning next day. In earlier morning 27 June When I came to Shanghai Consulate the VO was not in office and I chosen another VO for visa interview. The VO asked many questions about the relationship between my job and my PHD major. Then he asked me to provide my CV and told me they need to do administrator processing for my case. I have inquried Shanghai Consulate via 3 times with no positive feedback. In 5 August I let my US friend to contact with DOS, DOS guy told him that my case still in normal processing list with no red flag. With the crash of their VISA system last month, all the checking cases delayed with 2 weeks average. "

Lesson learned: phone calls and emails are basically useless. One or two emails to remind them of your aware of the processing is more than enough. there is noting to expedite the process, just be patient and relax. The average time span for the processing is 60-80 days, there is nothing to worry, so far there is no any case (H1B) being rejected from the checkee statistics.

I wish they can improve their efficiency.
------------------------------------------------
Dec 15 2014. Well, this is creepy. I checked the websites, and made the phone call from the last Friday till today, all the feedback is AP, no status, and 'your passport is in the consular'~~~~. So I decided to send them an email with that inquiry form system, which said for application over 30 days. I got the reply really soon, within 2 hours, which said my visa has been approved, and my passport is delivered to the bank~~~~. After I got the email, I checked back the websites and the phone call, still AP and no status. So, I don't know the exact clear time.
-------------------------------------------------
Dec 17 2014. The online status eventually updated to issued. And issued date was Dec 12 2014. The passport, even the webpage of the consular said only need two days to be ready, but it seems taking longer. I should applause for the only 3 weeks delay with this kind of efficiency.
-------------------------------------------------
Dec 18 2014, My last update, I got my passport today. Just give you guys a general idea about the time line here. Good luck to everyone."

some tips:

1: On the visa, it says, visa approved on Jan. 17, I would assume this is the date that the case got cleared from DOS at DC, but when I called in National Visa Center (603 334 0700), the representative said nothing but asked me to wait;

2. If you know you gonna be checked, do not use their drop-off box service, the delivery time back and forth to Guangzhou will be killing you. Also, for my case, I chose to pick up passport by myself at CITIC Taifu Plaza, which turned out also saved my flight ticket.

A few tips:
1.apply for a visa as early as possible(120 days in advance would be the best), especially if you are a first year PhD. You can lose your offer because of a delayed visa
2.contact your advisor and ask him to provide you with a shorter version of his resume
3.If you are only checked for around 30 days or even 40, relax~ it is very normal and common. Rest with your family and friends. Give some chances to those who has suffered for, let's say, 60 days.
4.I've seen a large amount of cases which are checked for 80+, 100+, 200+ days. When you've passed 60 days, it is inevitable that you will google some bad cases. The worst case I've seen so far is checked for a year without any result. I am not bluffing. So don't let your guard down. Anything can happen.

当时去办L1B的时候是星期三，在梅陇镇上海领事馆，面试过后也没有221g，VO把我护照放一边让我去柜台交多次往返费用，便继续处理后面的申请。

交钱的时候已经是中午了，我们去了柜台以后被告知中午休息时间系统关闭，给两个选择，要么下午再来付钱，要么给美金现金，我们没有现金只能离开领事馆，打算吃过午饭再回来处理。

但我们吃过午饭下午回领事馆的时候又被保安拦住了，态度很差，说是星期三下午领事馆例行休息不让进，case没处理完也没用，尼玛中午交钱的时候怎么不说，没办法我们进不去领事馆也没办法联系到那个VO，护照也在留在领事馆了，却没有地方投诉，只能离开。

回去的路上领事馆打了几次我的手机没听见，最后一次接通了，问我需不需要继续这个case，答案是肯定的，就让我们第二天再去一次。

第二天一早又去了领事馆，交完钱让我们坐在等待区等通知，过了半个小时过来两个好像是什么Stanley的工作人员过来让我们回去，问结果说不知道要我们回去查。

之后就是4个月漫长的等待。

H1b first time, I almost got my GC in US and I was interviewed by the officer for like 30 min. The Consulate General, Shanghai simply sucks!
The only effective way, which does not work in some cases neither, is to contact your local senator office. US law requires that the consulate must replay any inquires from a senator office within 3 business days. Even though the embassy claims that there is no way to expedite your case, they indeed have a line of cases that are to be handled in a much more prompt manner, the message from senator may (or may not, it depends) have your case into that line. 

If you are a professor or visiting scholar, you may try to contact IVO for help. 

But anyway, US consulate sucks...

----------------------------------------
Before case reached 60 days, there's very little we can do. Tried to contact the local consulate and the international office of the University which sponsored my H1B and they told me to wait. Called the National Visa Center four times but they told me different stories every time I called.

After the case reached 60 days, I tried three different channels to inquire the case status, including the local consulate, the international office of the University, and the International Visitors Office affiliated with the National Academies of Science.

Strict photo rule; has to be PURE WHITE background. If you wear glasses, prepare both sets of photos, with and without glasses. Also, prepare at least $10 cash. They may ask you to take another photo on site anyway.
If you choose to keep your passport with you (instead of leaving it at the Consulate), keep sending email to the Consulate when it hits the waiting time VO promised, specifically asking when they need you to send passport back. VO promised they will email me when my case is cleared and they need my passport back. (Not surprisingly) They never did."

给大使馆很多平台发过邮件，大多为套路回复，甚至有告诉我可能送去了DC审核的，吓死我了。后来打电话到DC问，case一直在北京的，算是松了一口气。DC那边电话很好打通，我是晚上10点打的，不过有一些rep.不愿意给你说怎么回事，只帮你查状态，就跟自己在网站上查一样。所以我锲而不舍，一口气打了三个，最后接电话的rep.很好心地帮我细心查了说系统上认为我没有交SEVIS费，简直神坑。于是联系大使馆，把收据扫描了发过去，之后第二周的周一发邮件问，告知已经更新。
不过从我发的N个邮箱地址来看，有一个邮箱地址挺朴实的，CIUBeijing@state.gov，每次都是真的有查一下我的case，然后告诉我状态，尽管不能加快速度，但至少可以让人放心，case是不是在正常审理。

看了很多人的过程 结合自己的经历 总结： 
1.checkee上B2没看到Check超过40天的，一个也没有。有些超长的肯定是僵尸记录。自己玩了一把心跳 在航班起飞前最后一个工作日issued 并且拿到
2.感觉催签是有一定用处的。途径上 feedback以及给华盛顿签证总部打电话比较有用。24号猛催一顿后，26号早上又发了feedback 结果26号的update和feedback同时下来 27号早上issued
3.还是希望大家多写点过程。等待的时候这些信息可以帮助大家做判断，渡过那段自己心疼机票老婆心疼旅游的焦躁时间。
4.最后祝大家好运！

补充：之前留了邮箱，问题都是如何催签。我的经历如下，是否适用于自己的情况还请自己判断：
‭1.我是一直没消息 后来仅剩一个礼拜 所以用申请网站每个人的那个feedback功能 中国的中英文热线 美国总部电话集中打了一通 后面就每天早上一封feedback 虽然回复都不是太有用 但是确实两天后update了也issued了 而且每次都是在我早上的feedback不久之后，很有可能是巧合，但反正做了总比不做强。
2.美国签证中心总部电话还请自行百度，很容易找到。不方便贴出。
他态度还行，他们是能够给出你的材料是否已经收到/何时收到这种信息的，所以肯定能看到很多信息。
3.我的经历只适用于B1/B2，其他签证我个人感觉不适用；B1/B2我感觉AP是99.99%不会refuse的，所以只是催时间的问题；但其他签证就不一定了，所以还是得区别对待。
4.对于大使馆邮箱，我发的邮件从没有回复过，我认为没用。
5.我认为对我有用的途径是：1.北京大使馆热线电话选英文；2.美国签证总部；3.经常用那个feedback功能（约面签的那个网站，需要登录那个），我感觉是晚上发美国回复，白天发北京这边回复，所以搭配起来感觉可以不断刷存在感。
6.还是希望真着急的人再去催，毕竟B1/B2只是时间问题。不着急的不要去总催，无论是否有用，催多了这路自然也就被堵上了。
7.虽然已经第二次AP，但对面仍是一个黑洞，我的经历不排除是一系列巧合，也可能是真起了作用，没人能说清；催签即使起作用的概率还是需要有很大运气的小概率事件，所以还是祝大家好运。

No news and no updates until 3/22 when officers (one American and three Chinese) from Embassy visited China office without pre notification, questioned for payroll of China company employees, took pictures of business license and some documents, requested re submission of the most updated organizational employee chart, spent about 30 mins in the office.

on 3/29 called DOS knowing that check was completed in the morning of 3/29, next stage is to request reciprocity fee.

问了去美国做什么，你的最高学历是什么，会说英文吗，去过哪些地方，去美国和谁去，你在这家公司工作几年了。没看房本、车本、学历证明、工作证明等，要去了Travel Plan 和CV，让我等4周，问问题基本是英汉结合。

总体感觉，因一直对去国外不太上心，因此准备不充分，没有委托任何机构咨询或代填写，都不知道哪些是敏感专业，还写了自己学的是分子药理学，目前从事IP工作，当时也不知道为啥被check，被check后，才在网上查原因。

我们前面是一个女生，听对话她应该是办理留学签证，VO是个女生，40出头的年龄，看起来严肃且严格，英语拷问了那个女生20分钟之久，最后还是杯具了，VO全程没有看到出现过任何笑容，女生最后绝望的问了句: can I ask for the reason? VO摊了一下手就到我们了。

我们是一家两口人一起面试，此前旅行的经历里既包含申根国家也包含东南亚国家，这次的计划也是去美西自驾旅行，所以对于办理旅行签证我信心还是很足的，但没有想到的是，VO似乎对我公司、专业以及职位非常有兴趣，针对这些展开了猛烈盘问，全程没有任何一个问题是关于旅行本身，也没有任何一个问题是针对身边的女票。我也被拷问了20分钟之久，后来才知道原因很可能是出自计算机行业，不过，好歹最后这位VO脸上出现了笑容，她还对我读书时候的经历很感兴趣，说她听到了一个很有意思的故事，最后拿出黄单子，告诉我们需要行政审查，只需要等待，不需要额外提交资料，全程唯一看的资料就是公司的营业执照复印件，收走了护照和这个营业执照复印件。

后来还申请过一次 B2 去美国开会，但是后来时间太紧没去成
两次都被 check 了大概一个月

当天经过：
我们下午最后一批，估计是那个窗口的最后一个了，签证官（年轻白人男士）可能要下班了，感觉略有一点嗨。
最先翻到我护照问 B2 签证办了怎么没去，然后我解释了一下。
接着就问我们准备去干吗，旅游准备去哪几个城市啦。
后来，看到我之前的 J-1 就突然开始跟我讲英语了，问我 J-1 呆的是哪个学校。
然后，突然话锋一转，问我们这次打算几号出发。
突然，就问了一下我老公做什么工作的。
还没回过神，就问我有没有带简历，然而我百密一疏，没有带。
我问他要不要看我现在工作的证明，他说不用，摆了个手略不耐烦的说相信我的啦。（？？？还有这种操作）

接着呢，黄单子就扔给我，让我补发简历和行程单给美领馆邮箱。
反正我们准备的材料他一个都没有看。

然后，就对着我家人说，你们三都通过了。
转向我，对我说，你补材料吧。

2、	问我是否会说英语？我说会，但有两年没讲英语了，不是太好，分公司年轻工程师会在语言方面帮助我的，我自己会很快恢复正常交流水平的。
3、	问去美国多长时间？我说大概6周。问地点？我说德州的达拉斯。
4、	问我去美国费用谁负责？我说是 母公司 负责（问完快结束时又问了一次，我重复回答了）。

5、	问公司这次派几个人去美国？我说就我一个。
6、	问公司为啥派我才加入公司一个月的人去美国？我说公司招聘我的原因就是因为我有二十多年油藏开发经验的经历，我有油田现场工作经验，有科研经验，有海外工作经验，也有管理工作经验，招聘我的就是缺少我这样的人才，目的是为了在母公司给子公司提供技术支持，并到美国子公司指导技术工作。
7、	问你以前从事过类似的工作吗？我说是，我以前去过哈萨克斯坦，去过安哥拉，去过英国伦敦开过会。
8、	问你个人简历带了吗？我说带了，递交后她问你是什么原因离开原公司的？我说原公司是小私企，拖欠我的工资。我没说没半年工资流水一事，人家也没问。

一个数着日子等签证的教训：如果你是有使领馆的城市，中信当天取也许是最快；如果你是其他省会或者中心城市有中信分行的，你还是应该选择邮政，因为中信真的时间不可控，邮政环节少也许更快；如果你是其他城市或者更偏远，估计两种方式也差不多。

首先要说苦主从12年MS开始出国到现在PhD第四年 三次签证 两check(5周内issued)一个一次过 所有的visa有效期都只有一年 鉴于上一次是一次过的 我以为这次会松一些 留出一个月时间回国 可惜还是没赶上一个很重要会议 现在俩月过去了 我老板都懒得催我听天由命了 所以说 还是别浪！
面签对答如流，要的材料样样俱全。建议所有F1准备：study plan/research plan; CV; Advisor Information; Coordinator/secretary information。 基本上过去几次签证 都找我要了这些。签证官问的问题我都能背下来了，签证官要的所有资料我都在她没要到的时候就第一时间找出来。然后一切都很顺利就AP了。所以我个人感觉，你有没有AP跟你面谈效果其实关系真的不大，在你提交DS160；case created的时候，系统就已经判断你需不需要AP了。
之后等待了两个月毫无更新 从第六周开始 打美国DHS电话 发邮件(发support-china那个 会建立一个case可以追踪 虽然卵用没有 但是可以确认工作人员有看到 图个自己安心) 都说要等等 打电话时候有个很绝望的词："" to="""" travel的网站上查到护照已经离开大使馆(周五)="""" visa="""" we="""" will="""" you="""" your="""" 但是仍然网站没有更新="""" 但是第二天美国dhs上班时候打电话还是老回复="""" 具体什么时候收到总行的护照="""" 发邮件="""" 周日不开门；周日给支行打电话="""" 在北京中关村支行拿到了护照，买机票明天飞了。="""" 并且周一打电话咨询的时候="""" 当天一般不会发邮件update因为还没录入完成，但是可以去取)。不是很懂为什么总行的大堂经理都用鼻子眼看人，支行的大堂小哥哥就那么亲切助人。可能我真的是过去问了个很蠢的问题吧。""="""" 提供uid就可以帮我去查="""" 晚上在us="""" 本来是周日去总行的="""" 第64天中午="""" 第65天中午11点半="""" 第68天="""" 第二天去北京中信总公司运营部拦截(应该是最快的到手方法)，但是中信周六不上班的，不上班！跟网上查到的一点都不一样！(中信的网站做的真的很烂="""" 第二天得到回复说已经ap完成了="""" 第二次update(第63天独立日放假)="""" 结果大厅职员翻着白眼告诉我我这种分发到支行的业务走对公="""" 给我回拨电话告诉我有没有到="""" 职员很亲切的跟我说了="""

我跟2个同学，一共三个人一起面试的，白人女性，笑嘻嘻的，结果一听到我说radiation就神色凝重了，后来check我们。我们被check之后，学校还有很多其他专业的去面签，几乎都被check了，以前医学专业都不会被check的，这说明最近中美关系紧张，但大家不用紧张，资料齐全不要缺行程单和简历，2周就能过，如果像我们一样缺行程单，还要收材料，核对，就要4周，成都check真的是比北上广慢多了！！！"

锦鲤好运,B1,New,ChengDu,oncology,Clear,2018-07-31,2018-08-28,28,自从7-31被check之后，我变成了神经病，每天都在心心念念查签证状态，然鹅，并没有改变，我知道要等3周左右才会更新，更新后很快就会issued，还是忍不住每天刷新几次。啊啊啊啊，我实在想不通为什么，我不是敏感专业，我是肿瘤学，医学专业也会被check。当然也可能是因为我没有准备行程单，为了让我补材料而check我。所以啊，大家材料一定要准备齐全，我当时就是信了她们的邪，我同学们之前面签也是出国开会，一样资料都没看。到我这儿所有资料都要齐了，所以说完全看面签官心情。还有就是谈话的时候不要说敏感词汇，我去开的那个会议名字里包含radiation，我讲到这个的时候，面签管抬头看了我一眼，真的是自己作死啊~~~~~

最后实在等不及了，在网上查到关于护照借出的方法。于10/17/2018发送邮件要求借出护照，结果10/18/2018就Issue了... 这其中的因果关系确实比较强

我自己分析是之前已经通过了美国本土的行政审理（09/05与09/19)，之后他们就把我的案子给搁置了。直到我要求借出护照才想起来处理我的案子，再一看已经快要60天了，就赶紧给了Issue。借出护照应该不适应于行政审理还没有通过的小伙伴，因为毕竟大使馆也要等所有审理材料的汇总才能做出最后决定。

以上都是个人分析，只能作为一个个案。由于美国签证系统的不透明，不适用于推广给所有申请人。

通信专业，申请的B2签证，没想到VO要了简历，没带，给了221g要求补充简历和在美行程。26号把材料和护照通过中信银行传递，29号显示护照到达领事馆。9月5号update了一下，兴奋地以为第二天会issue，结果并没有。。。等有消息了再更新。
9月26日第三次update，果然5号是开始处理我的case，过了21天的AP期，等着明天的issue！！！
27日中午Issue啦！

分享一下我的case，和老婆两个一起签的B2，预约的12号的签证，但是10号发现我DS160工作年份漏填了，10号晚上按照网上的方法重新建了一份DS160，后来才知道系统更新DS160需要2、3天时间，据说有人因为面签之前修改DS160导致无法参加面签。还好12号顺利参加了面签，后来查状态发现使用的是旧的那个DS160号，面签聊了两句，可能敏感专业，要求邮件补发CV，行程计划，发补充资料的邮件里也是用旧的那个DS160号。新修改的DS160号状态一直是no status。
8年前F1被check了一个半月，这是第二次面签又被check，批的快了一些。尚未拿到护照，希望能多给两年。。

目的：学术会议，一周。身份：医学生。
面签当天：常规问题：去干吗，去几天，是否大会发言，是某某校学生？
          结果：啪啦啪啦敲电脑，221g小黄条。收了护照、会议通知、简历。
          后续：未收到任何电话或邮件要求补交材料。然后是漫长的等待。
事后反省：鉴于Case Created时间早于面签时间，有网友的说法是160表格填写不妥，触发了check。建议一行人出去开会的，互相看下别人写的，自己填写的别太突兀。（因为我们一行人，每人单独签的，单位和事由均一样，但只有我被check）

补充建议：简历上一定要提供一个可以核实到你的背景信息的电话！单位电话有很多，留个靠谱的，万一被check了，增大存活几率。
          另，一定不要在160表格上提到PHD字样，哪怕是candidate。这是和身边人聊天，别人的悲惨案例。

我的建议：
尽量不要撤签，大使馆信息都是共享的，第二次签证会重新走流程，不会放人，尤其是5535。一签不会因为你撤签就停止审查，但是审查结果的确会被第二签采用(参考我们2.11北京和2.12广州的更新).我们如果不是二签，估计可以提前一个月拿到签证。如果你是5535，就不要折腾了，除非你有极其特殊的情况，比如我见过的美国老婆要生孩子，老公还在国内等签证。"

My passport was returned at the end of the interview, then it began the long wait. 
After 4 weeks, I started routine email inquiry weekly and in the 7th week (2018-10-30) the consulate replied to me and asked for additional documents. I submitted those required documents one week later. Meanwhile I still kept sending email inquiry once a week regardless of their response. On 27th, the consulate notified me to send my passport and I did so and got the 3rd update on 30th. Hopefully I will get my visa in the next week.

去美国八年多了每年都回来签证，第一次被AP。前两年是F1（文科），目前H1第七年（第三张I797），工作也是文科。之前在国内和欧洲各有一个IE的本科和硕士学位，貌似被VO紧盯着的是欧洲的这个理工科硕士学位

护照是9月份新换的，上面没有任何以前的美国签证或者其他国家签证

之前每年时间紧就面签，不紧就通过中信银行递签，面签基本上周一去面试周三就能领护照，递签也基本上是两个礼拜出头就回来其中大部分时间都是中信银行在运送。今年使馆里气氛明显显得紧张得多，谈话时间都多很多。公司今年以来各个国籍的都明显被大面积AP。有个瑞典人，合资业务从瑞典的外派高管，夏天回瑞典被拖了三个多月才拿到签证回美国。"

$F1请入群,F1,Renewal,BeiJing,STEM,Pending,2018-12-01,,113,"从去年2018年开始，美国对留学生签证申请突然收紧，有很多同学就从去年12月初寒假期间回国续签，至今杳无音信。也有2018年6月份，10月份，11月份面签的同学，签证依然在等待中。目前我们的微信群里现在有大约60人，相信还有更多没有统计到的学生。

很多人在美国的房子还继续付着房租，车子在暴雪中无人看管，研究和学业中断，生活的各个方面都蒙受很大的损失。每一天等待签证的日期都非常的煎熬，更重要是，根本不知道什么时候签证能等下来。我们已经联系了所有我们可以联系的人和机构，比如congressman, senator，但是每一次大使馆和Department of State回复一直都是签证还在pending中，无法预测什么时候能issue。 大使馆和Department of State给congressman/senator的回复也是类似的模板。

根据我们所了解到的情况，目前的签证政策导致的延迟，不仅仅是现在，在未来一段时间会影响更多回国返签和申请新签证的同学，影响的面会越来越广。

或许你刚刚被check快两个月，我之前也和你一样，请你看看10月，11月签证的同学，他们也是当初幻想着，等到三个月应该下来了吧？再等几周应该会出结果吧？一亩三分地老checkee和内部人士了解过后得知等待两个月以上，和等待三个月、四个月的概率是一样的。最近微信群里有位同学，F1首签，从18年6月开始等了8个月签证才issue。是现在的签证政策变了，大环境变了，不是你个人单纯的等待就有结果的。早点行动起来，让我们联名、抱团，我们已经受够了每天早上起来check，连一个update也没有的日子。也希望你早一点从能刷出来update的幻想中清醒过来。

我们希望在这里邀请更多已经check两个月以上的同学入群，我们一起统计check的情况，一起寻找有影响力的华人帮助，选择媒体帮助。快入群吧，希望我们联名上书的时候不要漏掉你！

超人,H1,New,ShangHai,Atmosphere Science,Clear,2018-12-20,2019-01-22,33,"这次申请H1b签证的时间表如下：
12/19/2018 case created.
12/20/2018 the first update (interview day, VO told me that it will take 3-4 weeks). 
01/18/2019 around 10:30 am 查到 the second update. 
01/22/2019 around 11:50 am 查到 issued. 

我是第一次申请学术的H1b, 大气科学专业， 没想到就被check了，经过了漫长的33天等待，终于issued了，后续不知道还要多久可以拿到护照。以下我总结了几点经验供后面的人参考。 

1. 如果是签H1b,建议提前准备I797 notice, 自己的CV，还有job description. 我在面试时被索要了这些材料。 
2. 面签可以稍微提早2个小时，我提早了一个小时去，大部队已经可以进去了，里面排队等满了人。
3. 十分感谢checkee.info这个网站，让我大致心里有数什么时间面试的人已经拿到签证了，而不是干着急。 
4. 上海大使馆的网站上有一个可以发邮件给大使馆询问非移民签证进度的网页，我发了第二天真的收到了回复，虽然是模版回复，至少我确认了我的case没有被忘掉，网页如下 https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/zh/embassy-consulates-zh/shanghai-zh/sections-offices-zh/shanghai-contact-us-zh/
5. CEAC这个网站每天更新的时间大致是上午10:30左右，下午4点左右。只有周一到周五会更新，美国节假日除外(比如01/21/2018昨天是马丁路德金日，查询大使馆节假日即可)。

最后祝所有的checkee都好运！如果可以的话，请donate一点给这个网站的维护者@mumuwang吧！

楼主1月25日再次更新：护照状态在签证issue一天后即1月23日出现更新(Origination Scan), 在1月25日从上海送到了杭州中信支行。

中间没有要求补件，议员律师没有催签。每周一次问询ciu，但都是模板回复，而且结合多名难友的经历，模板之间没有实际区别，基本可以断定是随机的。依据最近难友多方反应的情况，90天以内，不建议联系议员等，因为催签甚至可能会起反作用。。。
现在感觉40,60,90,120天，各自是一个坎，如果天数再多，实在不能等了，再考虑二签。或者是有重大变化，如h1b-&gt;h4, f签换了学校等等，再考虑二签。

$F1请入群,F1,Renewal,BeiJing,STEM,Pending,2019-01-01,,82,"从去年2018年开始，美国对留学生签证申请突然收紧，有很多同学就从去年12月初寒假期间回国续签，至今杳无音信。也有2018年6月份，10月份，11月份面签的同学，签证依然在等待中。目前我们的微信群里现在有大约60人，相信还有更多没有统计到的学生。 

很多人在美国的房子还继续付着房租，车子在暴雪中无人看管，研究和学业中断，生活的各个方面都蒙受很大的损失。每一天等待签证的日期都非常的煎熬，更重要是，根本不知道什么时候签证能等下来。我们已经联系了所有我们可以联系的人和机构，比如congressman, senator，但是每一次大使馆和Department of State回复一直都是签证还在pending中，无法预测什么时候能issue。 大使馆和Department of State给congressman/senator的回复也是类似的模板。 

根据我们所了解到的情况，目前的签证政策导致的延迟，不仅仅是现在，在未来一段时间会影响更多回国返签和申请新签证的同学，影响的面会越来越广。 

或许你刚刚被check快两个月，我之前也和你一样，请你看看10月，11月签证的同学，他们也是当初幻想着，等到三个月应该下来了吧？再等几周应该会出结果吧？一亩三分地老checkee和内部人士了解过后得知等待两个月以上，和等待三个月、四个月的概率是一样的。最近微信群里有位同学，F1首签，从18年6月开始等了8个月签证才issue。是现在的签证政策变了，大环境变了，不是你个人单纯的等待就有结果的。早点行动起来，让我们联名、抱团，我们已经受够了每天早上起来check，连一个update也没有的日子。也希望你早一点从能刷出来update的幻想中清醒过来。 

我们希望在这里邀请更多已经check两个月以上的同学入群，我们一起统计check的情况，一起寻找有影响力的华人帮助，选择媒体帮助。快入群吧，希望我们联名上书的时候不要漏掉你！

During the interview, the VO collected my resume and study plan. I claimed that my passport was lost and gave the VO the lost certificate and copies of old visa and passport. But I still received 221g form and was told to wait 3-4 weeks. I was very upset at first, because my friend who also lost his passport before was not checked when he was interviewed.

I was asked about the transcript. I really did not have it.
I was asked to present DS-160, offer letter, itinerary, resume, etc. I just offered what I had available with me. 
Yellow slip of 221(g) administrative processing was received after we met the VO.

The case was created on Jan 18th, 2019.
Updated on the date of our interview Jan 22nd, 2019
Updated on Feb 25th, 2019 for the second time.(I checked the status in the morning, there was no change, but it changed, when I checked at 4:11PM.)
Updated on Feb 27th, 2019 for the third time.(I checked at round 9:15AM.)
Issued later on Feb 27th, 2019.(I checked in a toilet of Beijing at 11:35AM.)

The passport status turned into origination scan, when I checked at 5:50PM, Feb 27th, 2019.

My case took 36 days to clear. Normally the status will be updated two or three times. The first update happened on the same day. If you are asked to submit documents, the second update probably happened when consulate receives the documents. Then, next update will be a milestone. Normally it indicates the investigation is done, and the result will arrive in one or two days. 

Wish every fellow Chinese good luck.

备注：
我的名字其实是 逃不开命运的纠缠。因为这ID对字数有限制，所以显示不全。
这一个多月，心情从焦急而又耐心，变成焦急不耐心，到抑郁不爽，到心情底线被挑战，最终到心情突然豁达啥都不在乎了。记住只有你的心情到了突然豁达这个阶段，签证结果就来了，炼好心情，挺住不怂。最近中美关系微妙，美国行政种种悬而未决的政策和声音，导致所有人各种类型签证申请都会遭遇行政审查，不确定性增强。
我建议在美国境内，如果出境需要申请签证的，最近尽量避免不必要的出境。
在国内需要申请签证的，如果是L或者H等工作签证，准备齐全资料，准备好心情和时间，应该都会过，只是时间问题，除非你被美国查到明显的硬伤，像安全威胁，犯罪，欺诈等。
学生签证，如果你是全日制的大学生刚刚要毕业，继续去美国深造，多数应该没问题；可要是挂着学习的幌子，实际上要有其他打算的，建议不要浪费这申请费了；再说说一些数次，锲而不舍申请美国签证，一年接着一年，一直被拒，有一定时间，大使馆一花一草一木你都了如指掌，至于你去美国的目的只有你自己知道的朋友，还是省省签证费和时间吧，有更多有意义价值的事情可以做。如果你真的有梦想，目前时间段很不理想，以后视情况而定。
我的微信号 71806435. 去美国的同胞都可以加，交个朋友，讨论各种问题。祝所有人好运！

$F1请入群,F1,Renewal,BeiJing,STEM,Pending,2019-02-01,,51,"从去年2018年开始，美国对留学生签证申请突然收紧，有很多同学就从去年12月初寒假期间回国续签，至今杳无音信。也有2018年6月份，10月份，11月份面签的同学，签证依然在等待中。目前我们的微信群里现在有大约60人，相信还有更多没有统计到的学生。 

很多人在美国的房子还继续付着房租，车子在暴雪中无人看管，研究和学业中断，生活的各个方面都蒙受很大的损失。每一天等待签证的日期都非常的煎熬，更重要是，根本不知道什么时候签证能等下来。我们已经联系了所有我们可以联系的人和机构，比如congressman, senator，但是每一次大使馆和Department of State回复一直都是签证还在pending中，无法预测什么时候能issue。 大使馆和Department of State给congressman/senator的回复也是类似的模板。 

根据我们所了解到的情况，目前的签证政策导致的延迟，不仅仅是现在，在未来一段时间会影响更多回国返签和申请新签证的同学，影响的面会越来越广。 

或许你刚刚被check快两个月，我之前也和你一样，请你看看10月，11月签证的同学，他们也是当初幻想着，等到三个月应该下来了吧？再等几周应该会出结果吧？一亩三分地老checkee和内部人士了解过后得知等待两个月以上，和等待三个月、四个月的概率是一样的。最近微信群里有位同学，F1首签，从18年6月开始等了8个月签证才issue。是现在的签证政策变了，大环境变了，不是你个人单纯的等待就有结果的。早点行动起来，让我们联名、抱团，我们已经受够了每天早上起来check，连一个update也没有的日子。也希望你早一点从能刷出来update的幻想中清醒过来。 

我们希望在这里邀请更多已经check两个月以上的同学入群，我们一起统计check的情况，一起寻找有影响力的华人帮助，选择媒体帮助。快入群吧，希望我们联名上书的时候不要漏掉你！
